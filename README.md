## API Usage:

The Customizable T-Shirt Page integrates with the OpenAI and Cloudinary APIs for custom logo and texture generation and image uploads, respectively. To interact with these APIs, the frontend communicates with the backend server using HTTP requests.

Code Example: Generating Custom Logos and Textures using OpenAI API

```bash

import express from "express";
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from "openai";

dotenv.config();

const router = express.Router();

const config = new Configuration({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

const openai = new OpenAIApi(config);

router.route('/').get((req, res) => {
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'hello' })
});

router.route('/').post(async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const { prompt } = req.body;

        const response = await openai.createImage({
            prompt,
            n: 1,
            size: '1024x1024',
            response_format: 'b64_json'
        });

        const image = response.data.data[0].b64_json;

        res.status(200).json({ photo: image });
    } catch (error) {
        if (error.response) {
            console.log(`Status Code: ${error.response.status}\nResponse Data: ${JSON.stringify(error.response.data, null, 2)}`);
        } else {
            console.log(error.message);
        }
        res.status(500).json({ message: "Something went wrong" })
    }
})

export default router;
```
